              <p>The Nairobi Hospital is a  355 beds  private hospital.  We have an outpatient facility that has been purposefully 
                separated from the urgent care unit. The urgent care unit is designed to receive patients who are in critical 
                condition and need immediate and specialized care. <br><br>The outpatient unit is for the walk-in patient who needs 
                care without having to wait for a more urgent case to be reviewed. The dialysis Center has ten ultra-modern 
                dialysis seats specifically designed for the comfort of the patient with several settings the patient can 
                choose from. The doctor’s plaza that is within the hospital has the best doctors in different specialties 
                at arm’s length for the convenience of the patients and the patients’ families.<br><br>
    
                The critical care unit consists of a fully equipped intensive care unit with twelve beds supported with a 
                nine-bed high dependency unit and a five cot neo-natal unit These are supported by four operating theater 
                rooms. There is a surgical ward and a medical ward.<br><br> Maternity, gynecology, and pediatric wards round up the 
                ward complement. It is worth noting within each ward, the rooms are divided into a single bed, two beds, 
                three beds, and the largest four-bed units all ensuite. The design of the wards ensures the dignity and 
                privacy of the patients even in our “general four bedrooms”.<br><br>
                
                The Nairobi Hospital’s mission is to deliver an unparalleled patient experience through a customer-centered approach 
                that leverages on innovation and an engaged workforce.
